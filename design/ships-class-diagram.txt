Ship:
--------------------------------------
Variables:
    size: integer size/length of ship.
    symbol: A single character. Represent the ship on your board.

    is_sunk: boolean flag indicating sunk status.

    position_list: List of lists of [x coord, y coord, damaged bool]. List length must match size variable. Also indicates the ship is placed on the board.
--------------------------------------
Functions:
    Initiator(size, symbol): Set the size and symbol per inputs and initialize is_sunk to False, position_list and damaged_posistions to empty

    set_positions(coordinate pair, direction): Fill position_list up to length of size with passed coordinate pair and coordinates per cell in direction.
    get_positions(): Return list of coord pairs from position_list without damaged indicator.
    reset_positions(): Empty position_list, to be used by external ship placement logic to prevent OOB and collisions.
        Replaced by set_position logic. Set position now reset.
    damage_ship(coordinate pair): Look through position_list for the passed coord, setting damaged bool if matched. Setis_sunk to True if all positions are damaged. Return True on damage, otherwise false.
