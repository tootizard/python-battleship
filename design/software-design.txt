Overview:
    Made in python

            Internet multiplayer*

    Boards
        If ships stored on host, we need two "board" objects to keep each player separate.
        Place ships
            Ensure no collision/overlap
        Hold the user's fleet
            An instance of each ship.
            This could be a list.
        Store prior attacks.


Gameplay mods:
    1 custom/"draw own" ship.
        Must be connected - no diagonals.
        Size limit 10 cells - multi-row is fine
            Maybe adjust shot counts for user.
        ? - mod ship symbol
    wind
        moves your shot based on direction and speed.
    More than two-player mode?
